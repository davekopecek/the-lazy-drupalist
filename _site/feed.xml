I was just sitting here, minding my own business, spelunking through a Drupal 7 render array, and when I looked up a techtonic shift had taken place.  One minute “there was a module for that”. You could tweak that module by digging in and twisting a hook to do what you need.  Then Drupal 8 dropped and it all got real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once we just had easy-to-remember hook names like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;hook_field_attach_prepare_translation_alter(&amp;amp;$entity, $context)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we’re supposed to create endless yaml files and “just write a plugin”.  A what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m no Luddite.  I came to Drupal from the land of objects (and IDE’s and integrated debuggers &amp;amp; profilers) and unlearned my ‘objectivity’, embracing Drupal like a slightly eccentric family member. You might say that for the past 11 or so years I’ve had an ongoing, rather intense, love-hate relationship with Drupal. I love what I’ve been able to accomplish.  From time to time I’ve had issues with various design decisions, but by and large if I stayed close to the current Drupal Way of doing things I’ve always been able to get done what I needed to with a minimum of muss and fuss. It might have been a bit quirky, but Drupal had a way about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There has always been &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blogs/jeff-geerling/the-drupal-way&quot;&gt;The Drupal Way&lt;/a&gt;.  Over time a person could discover The Way, stay close to it and leverage some incredible technology to create wonderful things.  If you skew toward &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cipsum.com&quot;&gt;MBA-Speak&lt;/a&gt; you might call it a set of &lt;em&gt;Best Practices&lt;/em&gt; for Drupal.  I shy away from that kind of hifalutin talk whenever possible. I just like to get things done and I like to repeatedly get predictable high quality results with minimal stress. Am I lazy? If going out of my way to automate and streamline and create things that work and are extensible so they can handle the unforseen so I can do other fun things makes a person lazy, then yes. Count me in. Until recently if you had the slightest inclination to do the least amount of work possible TDW was a wonderful thing and laziness was rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then, Drupal 8. Chaos! Bedlahm! Pandemonium! Don’t get me wrong, it’s some damn fine code, but it’s a huge shift. I think &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;The Way&lt;/code&gt; is still out there – evolving, but it’s damn hard to find. I’m having trouble and I have a feeling I’m not alone.  In the past year I’ve been to a DrupalCon, a Drupal Camp and several user group meetings and I keep running into people with basically the same problem:  There ain’t no way!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peoples… We’re going to find it!  The sooner we do, the sooner we can pop the footrest of our lazyboys back up and do what we do best. &lt;a href=&quot;http://thelazydrupalist.com&quot;&gt;The Lazy Drupalist&lt;/a&gt; will explore my attempts to keep sane and discover best practices for Drupal development while:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Migrating several Drupal 6 sites to Drupal 8&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Managing feature requests for existing Drupal 7 sites&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Creating and deploying sites in D8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this even possible?  Hell if I know.
